Known as a \"Father of the Internet\", he developed the mathematical theory of packet networks, the technology underpinning the Internet, while a graduate student at <a href=\"http://www.mit.edu\" target=\"_blank\">MIT</a>. This was in the period 1960-1962, nearly a decade before the birth of the Internet which occurred in his laboratory when his Host computer at UCLA became the first node of the Internet in September 1969. He wrote the first paper and published the first book on the subject; he also directed the transmission of the first message ever to pass over the Internet. He was listed by the <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Los Angeles Times</i></a> in 1999 as among the \"50 People Who Most Influenced Business This Century\". He was also listed as among the 33 most influential living Americans in the December 2006 <i>Atlantic Monthly</i>. Kleinrock\'s work was further recognized when he received the 2007 National Medal of Science, the highest honor for achievement in science bestowed by the President of the United States. This Medal was awarded \"<i>for fundamental contributions to the mathematical theory of modern data networks, for the functional specification of packet switching which is the foundation of the Internet Technology, for mentoring generations of students and for leading the commercialization of technologies that have transformed the world.</i>\"</p>\n<p>\n	Leonard Kleinrock received his Ph.D. from <a href=\"http://www.mit.edu\" target=\"_blank\">MIT</a> in 1963. He has served as a Professor of Computer Science at the <a href=\"http://www.ucla.edu\" target=\"_blank\">University of California, Los Angeles</a> since then, serving as Chairman of the department from 1991-1995. He received his BEE degree from <a href=\"http://www.ccny.cuny.edu\" target=\"_blank\">CCNY</a> in 1957. and his MS degree from MIT in 1959. He is also the recipient of a number of Honorary Doctorates across the world. He was the first President and Co-founder of Linkabit Corporation, the co-founder of Nomadix, Inc., and Founder and Chairman of TTI/Vanguard, an advanced technology forum organization. He has published over 250 papers and authored six books on a wide array of subjects, including packet switching networks, packet radio networks, local area networks, broadband networks, gigabit networks, nomadic computing, performance evaluation, and peer-to-peer networks. During his tenure at UCLA, Dr. Kleinrock has supervised the research for 47 Ph.D. students and numerous M.S. students. These former students now form a core group of the world\'s most advanced networking experts.</p>\n<p>\n	Dr. Kleinrock is a member of the <a href=\"http://www.nae.edu\" target=\"_blank\">National Academy of Engineering</a>, a member of the <a href=\"http://www.amacad.org\" target=\"_blank\">American Academy of Arts and Sciences</a>, an <a href=\"http://www.ieee.org\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE</a> fellow, an <a href=\"http://www.acm.org\" target=\"_blank\">ACM</a> fellow, an <a href=\"http://www.informs.org\" target=\"_blank\">INFORMS</a> fellow, an <a href=\"http://www.IEC.ch\" target=\"_blank\">IEC</a> fellow a <a href=\"http://www.GF.org/kfellow.html\" target=\"_blank\">Guggenheim</a> fellow, and a founding member of the <a href=\"http://sites.nationalacademies.org/cstb/index.html\">Computer Science and Telecommunications Board</a> of the National Research Council.

Kleinrock with the IMP\" height=\"386\" src=\"/data/images/lkimp.jpg\" width=\"300\" /> <i><br />\n		IMP1: The first node of the ARPANET</i></p>\n	<p>\n		It all began with a comic book! At the age of 6, Leonard Kleinrock was reading a Superman comic at his apartment in Manhattan, when, in the centerfold, he found plans for building a crystal radio. To do so, he needed his father&#39;s used razor blade, a piece of pencil lead, an empty toilet paper roll, and some wire, all of which he had no trouble obtaining. In addition, he needed an earphone which he promptly appropriated from a public telephone booth. The one remaining part was something called a &quot;variable capacitor&quot;. For this, he convinced his mother to take him on the subway down to Canal Street, the center for radio electronics. Upon arrival to one of the shops, he boldly walked up to the clerk and proudly asked to purchase a variable capacitor, whereupon the clerk replied with, &quot;what size do you want?&quot;. This blew his cover, and he confessed that he not only had no idea what size, but he also had no idea what the part was for in the first place. After explaining why he wanted one, the clerk sold him just what he needed. Kleinrock built the crystal radio and was totally hooked when &quot;free&quot; music came through the earphones - no batteries, no power, all free! An engineer was born.</p>\n	<p>\n		Leonard Kleinrock spent the next few years cannibalizing discarded radios as he sharpened his electronics skills. He went to the legendary Bronx High School of Science and appended his studies with courses in Radio Engineering. When the time came to go to college, he found he could not afford to attend, even at the tuition-free City College of New York (CCNY), and so he enrolled in their evening session program while working full time as an electronics technician/engineer and bringing a solid paycheck home to his family. He graduated first in his class after 5 1/2 years of intense work (and was elected student body president of the evening session). His work and college training were invaluable, and led to his winning a full graduate fellowship to attend the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the Electrical Engineering Department.</p>\n	<p>\n		At MIT, he found that the vast majority of his classmates were doing their Ph.D. research in the overpopulated area of Information Theory. This was not for him, and instead he chose to break new ground in the virtually unknown area of data networks. Indeed, in 1961, he submitted a Ph.D. proposal to study data networks, thus launching the technology which eventually led to the Internet. He completed his work in 1962 which was later published in 1964 by McGraw-Hill as an MIT book entitled &quot;Communication Nets&quot;. In this work, he developed the basic principles of packet switching, thus providing the fundamental underpinnings for that technology. These principles (along with his subsequent research) continue to provide a basis for today&#39;s Internet technology. Kleinrock is arguably the world&#39;s leading authority and researcher in the field of computer network modeling, analysis and design and a father of the Internet.</p>\n	<p>\n		But the commercial world was not ready for data networks and his work lay dormant for most of the 1960&#39;s as he continued to publish his results on networking technology while at the same time rising rapidly through the professorial ranks at UCLA where he had joined the faculty in 1963. In the mid-1960&#39;s, the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) - which was created in 1958 as the United States&#39; response to Sputnik - became interested in networks. ARPA had been supporting a number of computer scientists around the country and, as new researchers were brought in, they naturally asked ARPA to provide a computer on which they could do their research; however, ARPA reasoned that this community of scientists would be able to share a smaller number of computers if these computers were connected together by means of a data network. Because of his unique expertise in data networking, they called him to Washington to play a key role in preparing a functional specification for the ARPANET - a government-supported data network that would use the technology which by then had come to be known as &quot;packet switching&quot;.</p>\n	<p>\n		The specification for the ARPANET was prepared in 1968, and in January 1969, a Cambridge-based computer company, Bolt, Beranek and Newman (BBN) won the contract to design, implement and deploy the ARPANET. It was their job to take the specification and develop a computer that could act as the switching node for the packet-switched ARPANET. BBN had selected a Honeywell minicomputer as the base on which they would build the switch.</p>\n	<p>\n		Due to Kleinrock&#39;s fundamental role in establishing data networking technology over the preceding decade, ARPA decided that UCLA, under Kleinrock&#39;s leadership, would become the first node to join the ARPANET. This meant that the first switch (known as an Interface Message Processor - IMP) would arrive on the Labor Day weekend, 1969, and the UCLA team of 40 people that Kleinrock organized would have to provide the ability to connect the first (host) computer to the IMP. This was a challenging task since no such connection had ever been attempted. (This minicomputer had just been released in 1968 and Honeywell displayed it at the 1968 Fall Joint Computer Conference where Kleinrock saw the machine suspended by its hooks at the conference; while running, there was this brute whacking it with a sledge hammer just to show it was robust. Kleinrock suspects that that particular machine is the one that was delivered by BBN to UCLA.) As it turns out, BBN was running two weeks late (much to Kleinrock&#39;s delight, since he and his team badly needed the extra development time); BBN, however, shipped the IMP on an airplane instead of on a truck, and it arrived on time. Aware of the pending arrival date, Kleinrock and his team worked around the clock to meet the schedule. On the day after the IMP arrived (the Tuesday after Labor Day), the circus began - everyone who had any imaginable excuse to be there, was there. Kleinrock and his team were there; BBN was there; Honeywell was there (the IMP was built out of a Honeywell minicomputer); Scientific Data Systems was there (the UCLA host machine was an SDS machine); AT&amp;T long lines was there (we were attaching to their network); GTE was there (they were the local telephone company); ARPA was there; the UCLA Computer Science Dept. administration was there; the UCLA campus administration was there; plus an army of Computer Science graduate students was there. Expectations and anxieties were high because, everyone was concerned that their piece might fail. Fortunately, the team had done its job well and bits began moving between the UCLA computer and the IMP that same day. By the next day they had messages moving between the machines. THUS WAS BORN THE ARPANET, AND THE COMMUNITY WHICH HAS NOW BECOME THE INTERNET!</p>\n	<p>\n		A month later the second node was added (at Stanford Research Institute) and the first Host-to-Host message ever to be sent on the Internet was launched from UCLA. This occurred in early October when Kleinrock and one of his programmers proceeded to &quot;logon&quot; to the SRI Host from the UCLA Host. The procedure was to type in &quot;log&quot; and the system at SRI was set up to be clever enough to fill out the rest of the command, namely to add &quot;in&quot; thus creating the word &quot;login&quot;. A telephone headset was mounted on the programmers at both ends so they could communicate by voice as the message was transmitted. At the UCLA end, they typed in the &quot;l&quot; and asked SRI if they received it; &quot;got the l&quot; came the voice reply. UCLA typed in the &quot;o&quot;, asked if they got it, and received &quot;got the o&quot;. UCLA then typed in the &quot;g&quot; and the darned system CRASHED! Quite a beginning. On the second attempt, it worked fine!</p>\n	<p>\n		Little did those pioneers realize what they had created. Indeed, most of the ARPA-supported researchers were opposed to joining the network for fear that it would enable outsiders to load down their &quot;private&quot; computers. Kleinrock had to convince them that joining would be a win-win situation for all concerned, and managed to get reluctant agreement in the community. By December 1969, four sites were connected (UCLA, Stanford Research Institute, UC Santa Barbara, and the University of Utah) and UCLA was already conducting a series of extensive tests to debug the network. Indeed, under Kleinrock&#39;s supervision, UCLA served for many years as the ARPANET Measurement Center (in one interesting experiment in the mid-1970&#39;s, UCLA managed to control a geosynchronous satellite hovering over the Atlantic Ocean by sending messages through the ARPANET from California to an East Coast satellite dish). As head of the Center, it was Kleinrock&#39;s mission to stress the network to its limits and, if possible, expose its faults by &quot;crashing&quot; the net; in those early days, Kleinrock could bring the net down at will, each time identifying and repairing a serious network fault. Some of the faults he uncovered were given descriptive names like Christmas Lockup and Piggyback Lockup. By mid-1970, ten nodes were connected, spanning the USA. BBN designed the IMP to accommodate no more than 64 computers and only one network. Today, the Internet has millions of computers and hundreds of thousands of networks! Electronic mail (email) was an ad-hoc add-on to the network in those early days and it immediately began to dominate network traffic; indeed, the network was already demonstrating its most attractive characteristic, namely, its ability to promote &quot;people- to-people&quot; interaction. The ARPANET evolved into the Internet in the 1980&#39;s and was discovered by the commercial world in the late `80&#39;s; today, the majority of the traffic on the Internet is from the commercial sector, whereas it had earlier been dominated by the scientific research community. Indeed, no one in those early days predicted how enormously successful data networking would become.</p>\n	<p>\n		In the ensuing years since those pioneering days that led to the birth of the Internet, Kleinrock has continued as a prime mover at the frontier of the Internet and its growth and development. He has provided an international brain trust of Ph.D. graduates (39 to date) who populate major laboratories, universities and commercial organizations and who continue to advance the state of the art in networking. As one of the youngest members elected to the National Academy of Engineering, he was a founding member of the National Research Council&#39;s elite Computer Science and Telecommunications Board (CSTB). He chaired the committee that produced this Board&#39;s first report, &quot;Towards a National Research Network&quot;; in presenting the findings of this landmark report, he testified for then Senator Al Gore, which precipitated the Gigabit Networking component of the US Government&#39;s High Performance Computing and Communications Initiative.</p>\n	<p>\n		Today, four events have juxtaposed to create a crucial juncture. First, the Internet has exploded in use and reach (and no one controls the Internet, no one owns it, no one can &quot;shut it off&quot;). Second, the US Administration has vigorously promoted a vision of the Information Superhighway (the National Information Infrastructure - NII). Third, the entertainment industry, along with the telephone and cable TV industries, have recognized that there is a massive business opportunity in network-based entertainment. Fourth, the telecommunications networks have been deregulated. Indeed, the Internet and the World Wide Web are household words. The result is that huge sums of money are about to be expended by the private sector to wire up the USA. In the face of this, there are some basic questions as to what is the proper vision of future networking, what is the technology framework needed to realize that vision, who will design and deploy it, whom will it serve and how, what kinds of applications and services will it support, what is the role of government and of the private sector, etc. Once again, Leonard Kleinrock is leading the effort here by way of a National Research Council CSTB committee that he chaired, and that produced the widely circulated 1994 report &quot;Realizing the Information Future; The Internet and Beyond&quot;. This report took the country by storm, and he briefed many government and industry groups regarding its recommendations. Kleinrock&#39;s goal this time is to help formulate the guidance needed to bring the networking technology that he pioneered to society and industry for the greater good of this country and of the world.</p>\n	<p>\n		More recently, Kleinrock has taken the leading role in the new technology of Nomadic Computing and Communications; the idea is to create a technology that will support the nomadic user in his computing and communication needs as he travels from place to place.</p>\n	<p>\n		The potential impact of a ubiquitous information infrastructure is unbounded. The nature of the services and styles it can produce is limited only by the imagination of its practitioners. Kleinrock has always worked at the frontier of new technology. He chooses not to follow, fill-in, patch-up or catch-up. Rather, he takes the lead and opens up vast new technologies that have impact and excitement. Kleinrock has provided the leadership and vision to help bring this about .</p>\n	<p>\n		From a comic book to cyberspace; an interesting journey indeed!</p>\n</div>\n',NULL,'personal_history',0),(7,NULL,NULL,'bibwiki',0),(8,NULL,NULL,'bibwiki',1),(9,'<h1>\n	&nbsp;</h1>\n<h1>\n	Selected Videos and Photos</h1>\n<p>\n	&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n	<li>\n		<a href=\"http://www.cs.ucla.edu/csd/movies/kleinrockvideo/\" onclick=\"window.open(this.href, \'_blank\', \'resizable=no,status=no,location=no,toolbar=no,menubar=no,fullscreen=no,scrollbars=no,dependent=no\'); return false;\" target=\"_blank\">Kleinrock, UCLA and the Internet</a></li>\n	<li>\n		<a href=\"http://newsroom.ucla.edu/portal/ucla/electronicplay.aspx?fid=28174\" target=\"_blank\">Kleinrock Explains Packet Switching</a></li>\n	<li>\n		<a href=\"http://newsroom.ucla.edu/portal/ucla/electronicplay.aspx?fid=28176\" target=\"_blank\">The Day Internet History Was Made </a></li>\n	<li>\n		<a href=\"http://newsroom.ucla.edu/portal/ucla/electronicplay.aspx?fid=28175\" target=\"_blank\">The First Internet Router</a></li>\n</ul>\n',NULL,'history',0),(10,'<h1>\n	The Day the Infant Internet Uttered its First Words</h1>\n<p>\n	Below is a record of the first message ever sent over the ARPANET.

Leonard Kleinrock, a professor of computer science at the University of California-Los Angeles, connected the school&#39;s host computer to one at Stanford Research Institute, a former arm of Stanford University.</p>\n<p>\n	Forty years ago today, the Internet may have uttered its first word.</p>\n<p>\n	Twenty years later, Kleinrock chaired a group whose report on building a national computer network influenced Congress in helping develop the modern <a class=\"cnnInlineTopic\" href=\"http://topics.edition.cnn.com/topics/Internet\">Internet</a>. Kleinrock holds more than a dozen patents and was awarded the National Medal of Science last year by President Bush.</p>\n<p>\n	In an interview with CNN, the 75-year-old looks back on his achievements and peers into the exciting and sometimes scary future of the Web he helped create.</p>\n<p>\n	<b>CNN:</b> In basic terms, what happened on October 29, 1969, and what was its importance to the Internet as we know it today?</p>\n<p>\n	<b>Kleinrock:</b> Millions of people helped create this Internet. I basically supervised the creation of the Internet at the first node, both in the first connection and the very first message. We had just by then connected the first two host computers to the Internet. The first one was on September 2, 1969, when <a class=\"cnnInlineTopic\" href=\"http://topics.edition.cnn.com/topics/University_of_California_Los_Angeles\">UCLA</a> connected its host computer to the first packet switcher, the first router if you will, ever on the Internet.</p>\n<p>\n	But there was no other computer to talk to. So a month later, Stanford Research Institute received its interface message processor, or IMP, connected it to their host computer, and we created the first piece of the backbone network when a 50-kilobit-per-second line was connected between UCLA and SRI.</p>\n<p>\n	What we wanted to do was send a message essentially from UCLA to SRI&#39;s host. And frankly, all we wanted to do was log in -- to type an l-o-g, and the remote time-sharing system knows what you&#39;re trying to do.</p>\n<p>\n	So we typed the &quot;l,&quot; and we asked over the phone, &quot;Did you get the &#39;l?&#39; &quot; And the response came back, &quot;Yep, we got the &#39;l.&#39; &quot; We typed the &quot;o.&quot; &quot;Got the &#39;o?&#39; &quot; &quot; &#39;Yep, got the &#39;o.&#39; &quot; Typed the &#39;g.&#39; &quot;You get the &#39;g?&#39; &quot; Crash! SRI&#39;s host crashed at that point. So the very first message ever on the Internet was the very simple, very prophetic &quot;lo,&quot; as in lo and behold.</p>\n<p>\n	And, you know, we weren&#39;t aware that this was a significant event that would be recorded in history. We did not have a very effective message like &quot;What hath God wrought&quot; or &quot;Come here, Watson, I need you.&quot; Or &quot;One giant leap for mankind.&quot; We just weren&#39;t that smart.</p>\n<p>\n	When the host computers talked to each other, I like to say the Internet uttered its first words on that day.</p>\n<p>\n	<b>CNN: </b>Before October 29, 1969, was no computer talking to any other computer?</p>\n<p>\n	<b>Kleinrock: </b>Well, typically not over a data connection, no. What was going on at that time was that many users sitting at terminals were connected to time-sharing systems with a local connection. But that was just connecting to a single computer.</p>\n<p>\n	<b>CNN: </b>UCLA sent a press release about your work in July of 1969, just a few months before your October breakthrough. At the time, did you have any idea how far-reaching all this was?</p>\n<p>\n	<b>Kleinrock: </b>Basically, I said the Internet will be always on, always available, [and that] everybody with any device could connect to the Internet from any time and any location, and it would be as invisible as electricity. What I missed was the social aspect, namely that my 99-year-old mother would be on the Internet, as she was until she passed away two years ago. And by the way, at the same time, my preschool granddaughter would be on the Internet.</p>\n<p>\n	<b>CNN: </b>What is feature shock?</p>\n<p>\n	<b>Kleinrock: </b>Feature shock is a term I coined some years ago. Systems [such as Windows or Safari] contain an enormous number of features, each one of which may be valuable by itself, but no one is really able to use all the features. However, because you&#39;ve essentially paid for all those features, you feel guilty if you don&#39;t exploit them. So you spend time learning to use them.</p>\n<p>\n	I&#39;m a power user of PowerPoint. I spend thousands of hours learning how to use it effectively. If someone came along with a new version of PowerPoint that has a different interface than the one I&#39;m used to, and [even] if it were twice as good as PowerPoint, I wouldn&#39;t bother installing it.</p>\n<p>\n	We&#39;re overwhelmed by [features]; we don&#39;t know how to use them. It slows down the rate at which new applications and features are accepted by the public because of this investment they have in their thousands of hours of learning.</p>\n<p>\n	And I consider that a good thing. It allows a little more mature thinking in how we start hopping around in technologies and thereby losing the experience and history we had before. There&#39;s a kind of a measured way in which people will adopt new technology, and I think that&#39;s helpful.</p>\n<p>\n	<b>CNN: </b>What are you up to these days in the development of the Internet?</p>\n<p>\n	<b>Kleinrock: </b>I&#39;m working on what we call smart spaces, whereby the cyberspace comes out from behind the [computer] screen, where most people consider it residing, and moves out into your physical space so that there will be intelligence and embedded technology in the walls of your room, in your desk, in your fingernails, in your eyeglasses, in your automobile, in your hotel rooms all across the world as you move around.</p>\n<p>\n	<b>CNN: </b>If computers will be doing so much of our thinking for us, does that mean our brains will get less of a workout?</p>\n<p>\n	<b>Kleinrock: </b>It&#39;s always been the goal and desire of we technologists that as we provide capability that <a class=\"cnnInlineTopic\" href=\"http://topics.edition.cnn.com/topics/Distributed_Computing\">computers</a> are good at -- number crunching, file storage, massive databases that can be searched -- that it would free us up to do the things that humans do so well, like pattern recognition and putting thoughts together, intuition and innovation.</p>\n<p>\n	So it may relieve us of some of the mundane things that we don&#39;t do well. On the other hand, I personally regret that the youth of today are depending so much for their simple arithmetic calculations on these handheld calculators or wristwatch calculators that they don&#39;t know how to make change in the supermarkets anymore.</p>\n<p>\n	<b>CNN:</b> What other dangers could be ahead?</p>\n<p>\n	<b>Kleinrock: </b>There&#39;s a very dark side to the Internet, which we&#39;re all familiar with. It started with a worm in 1988, and it became spam in 1994, and now we have pornography, we have denial of service [attacks], we have identity theft, we have fraud, we have things like botnets [pieces of software that cyberthieves use to remotely and secretly control your computer], which really worry me.</p>\n<p>\n	One of the problems of the Internet is that we didn&#39;t install what I like to call strong user authentication or strong file authentication. We didn&#39;t anticipate the level of the dark side we see today. The culture of the early Internet was one of trust of all the users.</p>\n<p>\n	I knew every user on the Internet in those early days. It was an open culture. We shared everything we did. We got our gratification by putting things out there, which people could use. And there was an etiquette -- net etiquette if you will, which people behaved.</p>\n<p>\n	<b>CNN: </b>What about privacy? Is it dead?</p>\n<p>\n	<b>Kleinrock: </b>Yes, in a word. Yes.</p>\n<p>\n	And it was voluntarily given up in many cases. I mean, when someone lists their telephone number or uses their credit card or makes a cell phone call or even carries around a cell phone, that&#39;s an awful lot of info about where you are, what you&#39;re doing and some of your private matters.</p>\n<p>\n	There are cameras all over the place, and they&#39;re increasing in number. I like to say the only privacy we can expect is to go to the edge of the ocean, strip down and jump in and hope there&#39;s no sonar down there tracking you, by the way, which there will be soon.</p>\n<p>\n	<b>CNN: </b>Do you like to play video games over the Internet?</p>\n<p>\n	<b>Kleinrock: </b>The answer is no, no. I&#39;m not of that generation. Nor do I use Facebook or Twitter. I&#39;ve got enough things that demand my attention. ... E-mail is a wonderful black hole for my time. I don&#39;t want to have to answer tweets and SMS messages, following friends, etc. It&#39;s too demanding and too frivolous in many ways.</p>\n<p>\n	<b>CNN: </b>Do you have a certain emotional tie to the Internet as if it were a member of the family?</p>\n<p>\n	<b>Kleinrock: </b>Of course I do, and it&#39;s part and parcel to my DNA. But it&#39;s as aggravating to me as to anyone else in terms of when it doesn&#39;t work, when the applications don&#39;t work.</p>\n<p>\n	<b>CNN: </b>Were you always an inventor?</p>\n<p>\n	<b>Kleinrock: </b>When I was about 6 years old, I built a crystal radio from instructions I found in a Superman comic book. The thing that fascinated me was, I could basically get all the parts at no cost.</p>\n<p class=\"cnnInline\">\n	I was totally enchanted. This was magic, and I spent the rest of my life trying to figure out how that works. Life is one big puzzle for me in the positive sense. There are a lot of things to play with.

(Watch <a href=\"http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2009/08/090831-internet-40th-video-ap.html\"> video about the birth of the Internet.</a>)</p>\n<p>\n	The electronic dispatch was supposed to be the word &quot;login,&quot; but only the first two letters were successfully sent before the system crashed.</p>\n<p>\n	Still, that humble greeting marked the start of a phenomenon that has become such an important part of modern life that many experts argue access to it should be a right rather than a privilege.</p>\n<p>\n	In fact, earlier this month <a href=\"http://travel.nationalgeographic.com/places/countries/country_finland.html\"> Finland</a> became the first country in the world to declare broadband Internet access a legal right for all of its 5.2 million citizens.</p>\n<p>\n	&quot;I don&#39;t think it&#39;s quite on the level of food and water yet, but it&#39;s pretty close,&quot; said Jeffrey Cole, director of the Annenberg School for the Digital Future at the University of Southern California.</p>\n<p>\n	<b>Packet Technology and the Birth of the Internet</b></p>\n<p>\n	Created by the U.S. Department of Defense&#39;s Advanced Research Projects Agency, the original ARPANET was a network of just four computer terminals installed at universities and research institutions in <a href=\"http://travel.nationalgeographic.com/places/states/state_california.html\"> California</a> and <a href=\"http://travel.nationalgeographic.com/places/states/state_utah.html\"> Utah.</a></p>\n<p>\n	&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n	<embed allowfullscreen=\"true\" flashvars=\"vid=internet-40th-apvin\" height=\"334\" name=\"flashObj\" pluginspage=\"http://www.macromedia.com/shockwave/download/index.cgi?P1_Prod_Version=ShockwaveFlash\" seamlesstabbing=\"false\" src=\"http://video.nationalgeographic.com/video/player/flash/syndicatedVideoPlayer.swf\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"400\"> </embed></p>\n<p>\n	<i>Internet 40th Anniversary Video: Birth of the Internet</i></p>\n<p>\n	&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n	With its truncated missive 40 years ago Thursday, ARPANET became the world&#39;s first operational packet-switching network.</p>\n<p>\n	&quot;Packet-switching was the original transmission mechanism [for our network] in 1969 and is still the underlying technology of the Internet today,&quot; said Leonard Kleinrock, a UCLA computer engineer who was involved in ARPANET&#39;s creation.</p>\n<p>\n	In a packet-switched connection, a message from one computer is broken down into chunks, or packets, of data and sent through multiple routes to another computer.</p>\n<p>\n	Once all the packets arrive at their destination, they are pasted back together into the original message.</p>\n<p>\n	&quot;It&#39;s as if a long letter were written on a series of small postcards, and each postcard was mailed separately,&quot; Kleinrock said.</p>\n<p>\n	Packet-switching replaced a less efficient and less flexible transmission technology used by early telephone companies called circuit-switching, which relied on dedicated connections between two parties.</p>\n<p>\n	&quot;When you and I talk over a circuit-switched connection, that connection is totally dedicated to our conversation,&quot; Kleinrock explained. &quot;Even if we pause to take a coffee break, the connection is still ours and sits by idly while we are silent.&quot;</p>\n<p>\n	By contrast, data packets in a packet-switched transmission have multiple routes open to them and will hop on to the one with the least amount of traffic. In this way, no route is idle for long.</p>\n<p>\n	<b>40 Years Later, No One Owns the Internet</b></p>\n<p>\n	In the years following ARPANET&#39;s deployment, other packet-switching networks were created, but they were internal networks that had only limited access to one other.</p>\n<p>\n	It wasn&#39;t until the mid-1970s that engineers developed a way to merge networks to create the Internet.</p>\n<p>\n	In 1984 the domain system that includes .com, .gov, and .edu was established. A decade after that, the first commercial web browser, Netscape, became available.</p>\n<p>\n	Today the Internet is accessed by more than a billion users monthly.</p>\n<p>\n	Several companies and organizations contribute to its upkeep and operation. But no one owns the Internet, since anyone with access to a computer can create Web content.</p>\n<p>\n	&quot;If you put your PC out there and offer a news service or something &hellip; then you&#39;re considered a part of the Internet,&quot; Kleinrock said.</p>\n<p>\n	<b>Transformed World Marks Internet&#39;s 40th Anniversary</b></p>\n<p>\n	Although it&#39;s now hard to imagine life without Facebook, Google, and Wikipedia, the broad appeal of the Internet was something many of its inventors never predicted.</p>\n<p>\n	&quot;I am surprised, and totally pleased, at how effective the Internet has been in allowing communities of people to form, communicate, exchange ideas, and enter their daily lives in so many ways,&quot; Kleinrock said.</p>\n<p>\n	(Related: <a href=\"http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2009/10/091020-googling-google-web-searching-dementia.html\"> &quot;Googling Fights Dementia, Study Suggests.&quot;</a>)</p>\n<p>\n	For the last decade, a team led by the University of Southern California&#39;s Cole has been tracking the effect of the Internet on societies around the world.</p>\n<p>\n	&quot;When we started in 1999, it was already clear that the Internet was going to transform communications,&quot; Cole said.</p>\n<p>\n	&quot;What we could never have imagined is that it would transform virtually every element of business and social activity.&quot;</p>\n<p>\n	Cole predicts that in the future, more people will access the Internet through mobile devices such as the iPhone than via personal computers and laptops.</p>\n<p>\n	Currently about four billion people around the world have mobile phones, but only about a billion people use PCs, Cole noted.</p>\n<p>\n	&quot;We think the Internet is moving completely toward mobile.&quot;</p>\n<p>\n	(http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2009/10/091029-internet-40th-anniversary-birthday.html)</p>\n',NULL,'internet_turns_40',0),(38,'<h1>\n	<span style=\"font-size: 18px;\">Inside the Imp with Internet Pioneer Leonard Kleinrock</span></h1>\n<p>\n	<embed autostart=\"true\" fullscreen=\"yes\" height=\"370\" quality=\"high\" src=\"/data/flash/googleplayer.swf?videoUrl=http://www.PlatformationInc.com/k40/Kleinrock_One.flv\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"450\" wmode=\"transparent\"> </embed></p>\n<p>\n	NBCLA Gets a closeup look at the machine that made internet history, and the log that recorded it,in the second part of our interview marking the internet&#39;s 40th birthday.</p>\n<p>\n	(http://www.nbclosangeles.com/station/as-seen-on/Inside_the_Imp_with_Internet_Pioneer_Leonard_Kleinrock_Los_Angeles.html)</p>\n',NULL,'inside_the_Imp',0);

Known as a &quot;Father of the Internet,&quot; he developed the mathematical theory of packet networks, the technology underpinning the Internet, while a graduate student at <a href=\"http://www.mit.edu\" target=\"_blank\">MIT</a>. This was in the period 1960-1962, nearly a decade before the birth of the Internet which occurred in his laboratory when his Host computer at UCLA became the first node of the Internet in September 1969. He wrote the first paper and published the first book on the subject; he also directed the transmission of <a href=\"/internet_first_words.html\">the first message ever</a> to pass over the Internet. He was listed by the <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Los Angeles Times</i></a> in 1999 as among the &quot;50 People Who Most Influenced Business This Century&quot;. He was also listed as among the 33 most influential living Americans in the December 2006 <i>Atlantic Monthly</i>.

Leonard Kleinrock, a professor of computer science at the University of California-Los Angeles, connected the school&#39;s host computer to one at Stanford Research Institute, a former arm of Stanford University.</p>\n<p>\n	Forty years ago today, the Internet may have uttered its first word.</p>\n<p>\n	Twenty years later, Kleinrock chaired a group whose report on building a national computer network influenced Congress in helping develop the modern <a class=\"cnnInlineTopic\" href=\"http://topics.edition.cnn.com/topics/Internet\">Internet</a>. Kleinrock holds more than a dozen patents and was awarded the National Medal of Science last year by President Bush.</p>\n<p>\n	In an interview with CNN, the 75-year-old looks back on his achievements and peers into the exciting and sometimes scary future of the Web he helped create.</p>\n<p>\n	<b>CNN:</b> In basic terms, what happened on October 29, 1969, and what was its importance to the Internet as we know it today?</p>\n<p>\n	<b>Kleinrock:</b> Millions of people helped create this Internet. I basically supervised the creation of the Internet at the first node, both in the first connection and the very first message. We had just by then connected the first two host computers to the Internet. The first one was on September 2, 1969, when <a class=\"cnnInlineTopic\" href=\"http://topics.edition.cnn.com/topics/University_of_California_Los_Angeles\">UCLA</a> connected its host computer to the first packet switcher, the first router if you will, ever on the Internet.</p>\n<p>\n	But there was no other computer to talk to. So a month later, Stanford Research Institute received its interface message processor, or IMP, connected it to their host computer, and we created the first piece of the backbone network when a 50-kilobit-per-second line was connected between UCLA and SRI.</p>\n<p>\n	What we wanted to do was send a message essentially from UCLA to SRI&#39;s host. And frankly, all we wanted to do was log in -- to type an l-o-g, and the remote time-sharing system knows what you&#39;re trying to do.</p>\n<p>\n	So we typed the &quot;l,&quot; and we asked over the phone, &quot;Did you get the &#39;l?&#39; &quot; And the response came back, &quot;Yep, we got the &#39;l.&#39; &quot; We typed the &quot;o.&quot; &quot;Got the &#39;o?&#39; &quot; &quot; &#39;Yep, got the &#39;o.&#39; &quot; Typed the &#39;g.&#39; &quot;You get the &#39;g?&#39; &quot; Crash! SRI&#39;s host crashed at that point. So the very first message ever on the Internet was the very simple, very prophetic &quot;lo,&quot; as in lo and behold.</p>\n<p>\n	And, you know, we weren&#39;t aware that this was a significant event that would be recorded in history. We did not have a very effective message like &quot;What hath God wrought&quot; or &quot;Come here, Watson, I need you.&quot; Or &quot;One giant leap for mankind.&quot; We just weren&#39;t that smart.</p>\n<p>\n	When the host computers talked to each other, I like to say the Internet uttered its first words on that day.</p>\n<p>\n	<b>CNN: </b>Before October 29, 1969, was no computer talking to any other computer?</p>\n<p>\n	<b>Kleinrock: </b>Well, typically not over a data connection, no. What was going on at that time was that many users sitting at terminals were connected to time-sharing systems with a local connection. But that was just connecting to a single computer.</p>\n<p>\n	<b>CNN: </b>UCLA sent a press release about your work in July of 1969, just a few months before your October breakthrough. At the time, did you have any idea how far-reaching all this was?</p>\n<p>\n	<b>Kleinrock: </b>Basically, I said the Internet will be always on, always available, [and that] everybody with any device could connect to the Internet from any time and any location, and it would be as invisible as electricity. What I missed was the social aspect, namely that my 99-year-old mother would be on the Internet, as she was until she passed away two years ago. And by the way, at the same time, my preschool granddaughter would be on the Internet.</p>\n<p>\n	<b>CNN: </b>What is feature shock?</p>\n<p>\n	<b>Kleinrock: </b>Feature shock is a term I coined some years ago. Systems [such as Windows or Safari] contain an enormous number of features, each one of which may be valuable by itself, but no one is really able to use all the features. However, because you&#39;ve essentially paid for all those features, you feel guilty if you don&#39;t exploit them. So you spend time learning to use them.</p>\n<p>\n	I&#39;m a power user of PowerPoint. I spend thousands of hours learning how to use it effectively. If someone came along with a new version of PowerPoint that has a different interface than the one I&#39;m used to, and [even] if it were twice as good as PowerPoint, I wouldn&#39;t bother installing it.</p>\n<p>\n	We&#39;re overwhelmed by [features]; we don&#39;t know how to use them. It slows down the rate at which new applications and features are accepted by the public because of this investment they have in their thousands of hours of learning.</p>\n<p>\n	And I consider that a good thing. It allows a little more mature thinking in how we start hopping around in technologies and thereby losing the experience and history we had before. There&#39;s a kind of a measured way in which people will adopt new technology, and I think that&#39;s helpful.</p>\n<p>\n	<b>CNN: </b>What are you up to these days in the development of the Internet?</p>\n<p>\n	<b>Kleinrock: </b>I&#39;m working on what we call smart spaces, whereby the cyberspace comes out from behind the [computer] screen, where most people consider it residing, and moves out into your physical space so that there will be intelligence and embedded technology in the walls of your room, in your desk, in your fingernails, in your eyeglasses, in your automobile, in your hotel rooms all across the world as you move around.</p>\n<p>\n	<b>CNN: </b>If computers will be doing so much of our thinking for us, does that mean our brains will get less of a workout?</p>\n<p>\n	<b>Kleinrock: </b>It&#39;s always been the goal and desire of we technologists that as we provide capability that <a class=\"cnnInlineTopic\" href=\"http://topics.edition.cnn.com/topics/Distributed_Computing\">computers</a> are good at -- number crunching, file storage, massive databases that can be searched -- that it would free us up to do the things that humans do so well, like pattern recognition and putting thoughts together, intuition and innovation.</p>\n<p>\n	So it may relieve us of some of the mundane things that we don&#39;t do well. On the other hand, I personally regret that the youth of today are depending so much for their simple arithmetic calculations on these handheld calculators or wristwatch calculators that they don&#39;t know how to make change in the supermarkets anymore.</p>\n<p>\n	<b>CNN:</b> What other dangers could be ahead?</p>\n<p>\n	<b>Kleinrock: </b>There&#39;s a very dark side to the Internet, which we&#39;re all familiar with. It started with a worm in 1988, and it became spam in 1994, and now we have pornography, we have denial of service [attacks], we have identity theft, we have fraud, we have things like botnets [pieces of software that cyberthieves use to remotely and secretly control your computer], which really worry me.</p>\n<p>\n	One of the problems of the Internet is that we didn&#39;t install what I like to call strong user authentication or strong file authentication. We didn&#39;t anticipate the level of the dark side we see today. The culture of the early Internet was one of trust of all the users.</p>\n<p>\n	I knew every user on the Internet in those early days. It was an open culture. We shared everything we did. We got our gratification by putting things out there, which people could use. And there was an etiquette -- net etiquette if you will, which people behaved.</p>\n<p>\n	<b>CNN: </b>What about privacy? Is it dead?</p>\n<p>\n	<b>Kleinrock: </b>Yes, in a word. Yes.</p>\n<p>\n	And it was voluntarily given up in many cases. I mean, when someone lists their telephone number or uses their credit card or makes a cell phone call or even carries around a cell phone, that&#39;s an awful lot of info about where you are, what you&#39;re doing and some of your private matters.</p>\n<p>\n	There are cameras all over the place, and they&#39;re increasing in number. I like to say the only privacy we can expect is to go to the edge of the ocean, strip down and jump in and hope there&#39;s no sonar down there tracking you, by the way, which there will be soon.</p>\n<p>\n	<b>CNN: </b>Do you like to play video games over the Internet?</p>\n<p>\n	<b>Kleinrock: </b>The answer is no, no. I&#39;m not of that generation. Nor do I use Facebook or Twitter. I&#39;ve got enough things that demand my attention. ... E-mail is a wonderful black hole for my time. I don&#39;t want to have to answer tweets and SMS messages, following friends, etc. It&#39;s too demanding and too frivolous in many ways.</p>\n<p>\n	<b>CNN: </b>Do you have a certain emotional tie to the Internet as if it were a member of the family?</p>\n<p>\n	<b>Kleinrock: </b>Of course I do, and it&#39;s part and parcel to my DNA. But it&#39;s as aggravating to me as to anyone else in terms of when it doesn&#39;t work, when the applications don&#39;t work.</p>\n<p>\n	<b>CNN: </b>Were you always an inventor?</p>\n<p>\n	<b>Kleinrock: </b>When I was about 6 years old, I built a crystal radio from instructions I found in a Superman comic book. The thing that fascinated me was, I could basically get all the parts at no cost.</p>\n<p class=\"cnnInline\">\n	I was totally enchanted. This was magic, and I spent the rest of my life trying to figure out how that works. Life is one big puzzle for me in the positive sense. There are a lot of things to play with.

Leonard Kleinrock, a professor of computer science at the University of California-Los Angeles, connected the school&#39;s host computer to one at Stanford Research Institute, a former arm of Stanford University.</p>\n<p>\n	Forty years ago today, the Internet may have uttered its first word.</p>\n<p>\n	Twenty years later, Kleinrock chaired a group whose report on building a national computer network influenced Congress in helping develop the modern <a class=\"cnnInlineTopic\" href=\"http://topics.edition.cnn.com/topics/Internet\">Internet</a>. Kleinrock holds more than a dozen patents and was awarded the National Medal of Science last year by President Bush.</p>\n<p>\n	In an interview with CNN, the 75-year-old looks back on his achievements and peers into the exciting and sometimes scary future of the Web he helped create.</p>\n<p>\n	<b>CNN:</b> In basic terms, what happened on October 29, 1969, and what was its importance to the Internet as we know it today?</p>\n<p>\n	<b>Kleinrock:</b> Millions of people helped create this Internet. I basically supervised the creation of the Internet at the first node, both in the first connection and the very first message. We had just by then connected the first two host computers to the Internet. The first one was on September 2, 1969, when <a class=\"cnnInlineTopic\" href=\"http://topics.edition.cnn.com/topics/University_of_California_Los_Angeles\">UCLA</a> connected its host computer to the first packet switcher, the first router if you will, ever on the Internet.</p>\n<p>\n	But there was no other computer to talk to. So a month later, Stanford Research Institute received its interface message processor, or IMP, connected it to their host computer, and we created the first piece of the backbone network when a 50-kilobit-per-second line was connected between UCLA and SRI.</p>\n<p>\n	What we wanted to do was send a message essentially from UCLA to SRI&#39;s host. And frankly, all we wanted to do was log in -- to type an l-o-g, and the remote time-sharing system knows what you&#39;re trying to do.</p>\n<p>\n	So we typed the &quot;l,&quot; and we asked over the phone, &quot;Did you get the &#39;l?&#39; &quot; And the response came back, &quot;Yep, we got the &#39;l.&#39; &quot; We typed the &quot;o.&quot; &quot;Got the &#39;o?&#39; &quot; &quot; &#39;Yep, got the &#39;o.&#39; &quot; Typed the &#39;g.&#39; &quot;You get the &#39;g?&#39; &quot; Crash! SRI&#39;s host crashed at that point. So the very first message ever on the Internet was the very simple, very prophetic &quot;lo,&quot; as in lo and behold.</p>\n<p>\n	And, you know, we weren&#39;t aware that this was a significant event that would be recorded in history. We did not have a very effective message like &quot;What hath God wrought&quot; or &quot;Come here, Watson, I need you.&quot; Or &quot;One giant leap for mankind.&quot; We just weren&#39;t that smart.</p>\n<p>\n	When the host computers talked to each other, I like to say the Internet uttered its first words on that day.</p>\n<p>\n	<b>CNN: </b>Before October 29, 1969, was no computer talking to any other computer?</p>\n<p>\n	<b>Kleinrock: </b>Well, typically not over a data connection, no. What was going on at that time was that many users sitting at terminals were connected to time-sharing systems with a local connection. But that was just connecting to a single computer.</p>\n<p>\n	<b>CNN: </b>UCLA sent a press release about your work in July of 1969, just a few months before your October breakthrough.

In this way, no route is idle for long.</p>\n<p>\n	<b>40 Years Later, No One Owns the Internet</b></p>\n<p>\n	In the years following ARPANET&#39;s deployment, other packet-switching networks were created, but they were internal networks that had only limited access to one other.</p>\n<p>\n	It wasn&#39;t until the mid-1970s that engineers developed a way to merge networks to create the Internet.</p>\n<p>\n	In 1984 the domain system that includes .com, .gov, and .edu was established.

Leonard Kleinrock, a professor of computer science at the University of California-Los Angeles, connected the school&#39;s host computer to one at Stanford Research Institute, a former arm of Stanford University.</p>\n<p>\n	Forty years ago today, the Internet may have uttered its first word.</p>\n<p>\n	Twenty years later, Kleinrock chaired a group whose report on building a national computer network influenced Congress in helping develop the modern <a class=\"cnnInlineTopic\" href=\"http://topics.edition.cnn.com/topics/Internet\">Internet</a>. Kleinrock holds more than a dozen patents and was awarded the National Medal of Science last year by President Bush.</p>\n<p>\n	In an interview with CNN, the 75-year-old looks back on his achievements and peers into the exciting and sometimes scary future of the Web he helped create.</p>\n<p>\n	<b>CNN:</b> In basic terms, what happened on October 29, 1969, and what was its importance to the Internet as we know it today?</p>\n<p>\n	<b>Kleinrock:</b> Millions of people helped create this Internet. I basically supervised the creation of the Internet at the first node, both in the first connection and the very first message. We had just by then connected the first two host computers to the Internet. The first one was on September 2, 1969, when <a class=\"cnnInlineTopic\" href=\"http://topics.edition.cnn.com/topics/University_of_California_Los_Angeles\">UCLA</a> connected its host computer to the first packet switcher, the first router if you will, ever on the Internet.</p>\n<p>\n	But there was no other computer to talk to. So a month later, Stanford Research Institute received its interface message processor, or IMP, connected it to their host computer, and we created the first piece of the backbone network when a 50-kilobit-per-second line was connected between UCLA and SRI.</p>\n<p>\n	What we wanted to do was send a message essentially from UCLA to SRI&#39;s host. And frankly, all we wanted to do was log in -- to type an l-o-g, and the remote time-sharing system knows what you&#39;re trying to do.</p>\n<p>\n	So we typed the &quot;l,&quot; and we asked over the phone, &quot;Did you get the &#39;l?&#39; &quot; And the response came back, &quot;Yep, we got the &#39;l.&#39; &quot; We typed the &quot;o.&quot; &quot;Got the &#39;o?&#39; &quot; &quot; &#39;Yep, got the &#39;o.&#39; &quot; Typed the &#39;g.&#39; &quot;You get the &#39;g?&#39; &quot; Crash! SRI&#39;s host crashed at that point. So the very first message ever on the Internet was the very simple, very prophetic &quot;lo,&quot; as in lo and behold.</p>\n<p>\n	And, you know, we weren&#39;t aware that this was a significant event that would be recorded in history. We did not have a very effective message like &quot;What hath God wrought&quot; or &quot;Come here, Watson, I need you.&quot; Or &quot;One giant leap for mankind.&quot; We just weren&#39;t that smart.</p>\n<p>\n	When the host computers talked to each other, I like to say the Internet uttered its first words on that day.</p>\n<p>\n	<b>CNN: </b>Before October 29, 1969, was no computer talking to any other computer?</p>\n<p>\n	<b>Kleinrock: </b>Well, typically not over a data connection, no. What was going on at that time was that many users sitting at terminals were connected to time-sharing systems with a local connection. But that was just connecting to a single computer.</p>\n<p>\n	<b>CNN: </b>UCLA sent a press release about your work in July of 1969, just a few months before your October breakthrough. At the time, did you have any idea how far-reaching all this was?</p>\n<p>\n	<b>Kleinrock: </b>Basically, I said the Internet will be always on, always available, [and that] everybody with any device could connect to the Internet from any time and any location, and it would be as invisible as electricity. What I missed was the social aspect, namely that my 99-year-old mother would be on the Internet, as she was until she passed away two years ago. And by the way, at the same time, my preschool granddaughter would be on the Internet.</p>\n<p>\n	<b>CNN: </b>What is feature shock?</p>\n<p>\n	<b>Kleinrock: </b>Feature shock is a term I coined some years ago. Systems [such as Windows or Safari] contain an enormous number of features, each one of which may be valuable by itself, but no one is really able to use all the features. However, because you&#39;ve essentially paid for all those features, you feel guilty if you don&#39;t exploit them. So you spend time learning to use them.</p>\n<p>\n	I&#39;m a power user of PowerPoint. I spend thousands of hours learning how to use it effectively. If someone came along with a new version of PowerPoint that has a different interface than the one I&#39;m used to, and [even] if it were twice as good as PowerPoint, I wouldn&#39;t bother installing it.</p>\n<p>\n	We&#39;re overwhelmed by [features]; we don&#39;t know how to use them. It slows down the rate at which new applications and features are accepted by the public because of this investment they have in their thousands of hours of learning.</p>\n<p>\n	And I consider that a good thing. It allows a little more mature thinking in how we start hopping around in technologies and thereby losing the experience and history we had before. There&#39;s a kind of a measured way in which people will adopt new technology, and I think that&#39;s helpful.</p>\n<p>\n	<b>CNN: </b>What are you up to these days in the development of the Internet?</p>\n<p>\n	<b>Kleinrock: </b>I&#39;m working on what we call smart spaces, whereby the cyberspace comes out from behind the [computer] screen, where most people consider it residing, and moves out into your physical space so that there will be intelligence and embedded technology in the walls of your room, in your desk, in your fingernails, in your eyeglasses, in your automobile, in your hotel rooms all across the world as you move around.</p>\n<p>\n	<b>CNN: </b>If computers will be doing so much of our thinking for us, does that mean our brains will get less of a workout?</p>\n<p>\n	<b>Kleinrock: </b>It&#39;s always been the goal and desire of we technologists that as we provide capability that <a class=\"cnnInlineTopic\" href=\"http://topics.edition.cnn.com/topics/Distributed_Computing\">computers</a> are good at -- number crunching, file storage, massive databases that can be searched -- that it would free us up to do the things that humans do so well, like pattern recognition and putting thoughts together, intuition and innovation.</p>\n<p>\n	So it may relieve us of some of the mundane things that we don&#39;t do well. On the other hand, I personally regret that the youth of today are depending so much for their simple arithmetic calculations on these handheld calculators or wristwatch calculators that they don&#39;t know how to make change in the supermarkets anymore.</p>\n<p>\n	<b>CNN:</b> What other dangers could be ahead?</p>\n<p>\n	<b>Kleinrock: </b>There&#39;s a very dark side to the Internet, which we&#39;re all familiar with. It started with a worm in 1988, and it became spam in 1994, and now we have pornography, we have denial of service [attacks], we have identity theft, we have fraud, we have things like botnets [pieces of software that cyberthieves use to remotely and secretly control your computer], which really worry me.</p>\n<p>\n	One of the problems of the Internet is that we didn&#39;t install what I like to call strong user authentication or strong file authentication. We didn&#39;t anticipate the level of the dark side we see today. The culture of the early Internet was one of trust of all the users.</p>\n<p>\n	I knew every user on the Internet in those early days. It was an open culture. We shared everything we did. We got our gratification by putting things out there, which people could use. And there was an etiquette -- net etiquette if you will, which people behaved.</p>\n<p>\n	<b>CNN: </b>What about privacy? Is it dead?</p>\n<p>\n	<b>Kleinrock: </b>Yes, in a word. Yes.</p>\n<p>\n	And it was voluntarily given up in many cases. I mean, when someone lists their telephone number or uses their credit card or makes a cell phone call or even carries around a cell phone, that&#39;s an awful lot of info about where you are, what you&#39;re doing and some of your private matters.</p>\n<p>\n	There are cameras all over the place, and they&#39;re increasing in number. I like to say the only privacy we can expect is to go to the edge of the ocean, strip down and jump in and hope there&#39;s no sonar down there tracking you, by the way, which there will be soon.</p>\n<p>\n	<b>CNN: </b>Do you like to play video games over the Internet?</p>\n<p>\n	<b>Kleinrock: </b>The answer is no, no. I&#39;m not of that generation. Nor do I use Facebook or Twitter. I&#39;ve got enough things that demand my attention. ... E-mail is a wonderful black hole for my time. I don&#39;t want to have to answer tweets and SMS messages, following friends, etc. It&#39;s too demanding and too frivolous in many ways.</p>\n<p>\n	<b>CNN: </b>Do you have a certain emotional tie to the Internet as if it were a member of the family?</p>\n<p>\n	<b>Kleinrock: </b>Of course I do, and it&#39;s part and parcel to my DNA. But it&#39;s as aggravating to me as to anyone else in terms of when it doesn&#39;t work, when the applications don&#39;t work.</p>\n<p>\n	<b>CNN: </b>Were you always an inventor?</p>\n<p>\n	<b>Kleinrock: </b>When I was about 6 years old, I built a crystal radio from instructions I found in a Superman comic book. The thing that fascinated me was, I could basically get all the parts at no cost.</p>\n<p class=\"cnnInline\">\n	I was totally enchanted. This was magic, and I spent the rest of my life trying to figure out how that works. Life is one big puzzle for me in the positive sense. There are a lot of things to play with.
